\begin{cvletter}

I am sincerely writing this motivation letter to express my interest in the New Grad Software Engineer position in Databricks. I have a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Computer Science, and hands-on experience using multiple programming languages(Especially Java and Python) to do software development. 

During my final stage of pursuing my master's degree in Sweden, I was employed as a research master thesis intern in Ericsson. I  learned dockerization and cutting-edge technology about container orchestration systems ( e.g. Kubernetes/Istio). Considering the infrastructure of edge computing is geographically distributed, I proposed an optimized service routing algorithm based on Istio, which can decrease the message transmitting time among multi-clusters. Emulation experiments were also designed and carried out to prove the efficiency of the algorithm. The results show that the message transmitting time is reduced by 24\% with my solution. I gained experience with Docker, Kubernetes, and Google Could stack through this process.

After I graduated last year,  I joined ING as a software engineer. Through this year,  I got chances to switch between three squads in different fields, the tech stack I used include Java Spring, Python Devlopmet, and ELK stack. During my second assignment, I built a file system monitoring tool using Pytest-BDD and successfully deployed it in the production environment using Docker Swarm. Currently, I am implementing a RESTful API with Java Spring Boot and MongoDB. Apart from the backend development, I also assist my squad members to do front end development using web components and Javascript. Switching between different teams also taught me collaboration and communication skills.

My academic experience helped me to build a solid background in Cloud Computing related areas.  My previous working experience let me learn about the agile way of working, the software development lifecycle and honed my coding skills. Professionally, Databricks gathers world-class engineers and provides leading enterprise cloud services. Culturally,  the inclusive culture and diversity in the company are attractive. I want to be part of the team and collaborate with all those brilliant colleagues.

I hope that my enthusiasm is conveyed in this application. Thank you for your time and consideration.
